# Real-Time-Object-Detection
Real Time Object Detection using yolov3. 
YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once, Version 3) is a real-time object detection algorithm that identifies specific objects in videos, live feeds, or images.
In the given code user can do detection in real time or through recorded videos.
The model is trained using coco.names labels. The cfg files and weight files for yolov3 can be downloaded from the internet.
